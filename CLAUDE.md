- **Responsive Design**: Automatic switching between desktop nav bar and mobile hamburger menu at 768px breakpoint
- **Touch-Optimized**: Larger touch targets (48px minimum) for better mobile usability

### User Experience Enhancements ✅

### Performance Optimizations ⚡
- **Extracted CSS**: Moved 1400+ lines of inline CSS to external `premium-styles.css` file
- **Faster Initial Load**: Reduced HTML size for quicker first contentful paint
- **Optimized Assets**: External stylesheets are cached by browser

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Mobile Menu Solution
After extensive troubleshooting with CSS conflicts, implemented a simple, working solution:
```html
<!-- Dedicated mobile menu with inline styles to avoid conflicts -->
<div id="simpleMenu"> <!-- navigation links --> </div>
<button id="menuBtn">☰</button>
```
- Uses ID selectors to avoid class conflicts
- Inline critical styles ensure consistent behavior
- Simple class toggle mechanism (`classList.toggle('show')`)

#### File Structure
- `index.html` - Main application with mobile navigation
- `premium-styles.css` - Extracted styles (42KB)
- `backup-2025-09-04-222845/` - Pre-update backup

### Known Issues Fixed
- ✅ Mobile menu not appearing (CSS conflicts resolved)
- ✅ Desktop navigation disappearing (media query fix)
- ✅ Filter button duplication (removed from top nav)
- ✅ Touch targets too small on mobile (increased to 48px+)

### Testing Notes
- Mobile breakpoint: 768px
- Tested on Chrome mobile emulator
- Hamburger menu working on all mobile viewport sizes
- Desktop navigation intact above 768px
