# Mobile Roulette Optimization Test Plan

## Test Devices

### Primary Targets

- iPhone SE (2nd gen) - iOS 15+
- Samsung Galaxy A12 - Android 11+
- iPhone 8 - iOS 14+
- Moto G7 - Android 10+

### Low-End Device Testing

- Devices with <4GB RAM
- Devices with <4 CPU cores
- Older GPU models (Mali-4xx, Adreno 3xx, PowerVR SGX)

## Performance Metrics to Track

### 1. Frame Rate Testing

- **Tool**: Chrome DevTools Performance Monitor
- **Target**: â‰¥30 FPS during animations
- **Steps**:
  1. Open Chrome DevTools > Performance tab
  2. Start recording before triggering roulette
  3. Complete full roulette sequence
  4. Check FPS graph for drops below 30

### 2. Animation Duration

- **Target**: 4-6 seconds total (vs 8-12s baseline)
- **Measure**:
  - Class selection: Should complete in ~2s
  - Spin selection: Should complete in ~1.5s
  - Wheel spin: Should complete in ~4s
  - Ball animation: Should complete in ~3.5s

### 3. CPU/GPU Usage

- **Tool**: Chrome DevTools Performance tab
- **Target**: <70% CPU usage during animations
- **Check for**:
  - Long tasks (>50ms)
  - Excessive repaints
  - Layout thrashing

### 4. Memory Usage

- **Tool**: Chrome DevTools Memory tab
- **Target**: <50MB additional memory during animations
- **Monitor**:
  - Memory leaks from particle effects
  - DOM node count
  - Event listener accumulation

## Visual Quality Checklist

### Mobile Visual Elements

- [ ] No backdrop blur visible (solid overlay instead)
- [ ] Reduced particle count (2 particles visible)
- [ ] No complex shadows or glows
- [ ] Smooth wheel rotation without stuttering
- [ ] Ball animation visible and smooth
- [ ] No visual glitches or tearing

### Audio Performance

- [ ] Tick sounds play without skipping
- [ ] Volume appropriately reduced
- [ ] No audio delays or stuttering
- [ ] Win sounds play correctly

## Functional Testing

### 1. Basic Flow

1. Tap "Generate Loadout" button
2. Verify class roulette appears and animates
3. Verify spin count selection works
4. Verify slot machine starts after roulette
5. Check loadout displays correctly

### 2. Edge Cases

- [ ] Multiple rapid taps don't break animation
- [ ] Background/foreground app switching
- [ ] Screen rotation during animation
- [ ] Low battery mode behavior
- [ ] Poor network conditions

### 3. Device-Specific Tests

- [ ] Test with device in power saving mode
- [ ] Test with multiple apps in background
- [ ] Test after extended usage (thermal throttling)
- [ ] Test with accessibility features enabled

## Performance Regression Tests

### Baseline Measurements

1. Record baseline FPS without optimizations
2. Record baseline animation times
3. Record baseline CPU/Memory usage

### Optimization Validation

1. Enable optimizations
2. Compare all metrics against baseline
3. Document improvement percentages

## User Experience Testing

### Perception Tests

1. Does animation still feel exciting?
2. Is the reduced duration noticeable?
3. Do particles still add visual interest?
4. Does audio enhance the experience?

### A/B Testing Metrics

- Bounce rate comparison
- Session duration
- Feature engagement rate
- User feedback scores

## Automated Testing

### Performance Budget

```javascript
// Add to CI/CD pipeline
const performanceBudget = {
  fps: { min: 30, target: 60 },
  animationDuration: { max: 6000 }, // 6 seconds
  memoryIncrease: { max: 50 }, // 50MB
  cpuUsage: { max: 70 }, // 70%
};
```

### Monitoring Script

```javascript
// Add to production monitoring
function trackRoulettePerformance() {
  const startTime = performance.now();
  let frameCount = 0;

  const measureFPS = () => {
    frameCount++;
    const elapsed = performance.now() - startTime;
    if (elapsed >= 1000) {
      console.log(`FPS: ${frameCount}`);
      // Send to analytics
      gtag("event", "roulette_fps", {
        value: frameCount,
        device_type: window.state?.isMobile ? "mobile" : "desktop",
      });
    }
  };

  // Track during animation
  requestAnimationFrame(measureFPS);
}
```

## Rollback Criteria

Revert optimizations if:

- FPS drops below 25 on target devices
- Animation glitches reported by >5% of users
- Audio sync issues on >10% of devices
- Memory leaks detected in production

## Sign-off Checklist

- [ ] All target devices tested
- [ ] Performance metrics meet goals
- [ ] Visual quality acceptable
- [ ] No functional regressions
- [ ] User feedback positive
- [ ] Monitoring in place
- [ ] Rollback plan ready
