“NeoJackpot” Visual Theme – Vegas x Cyberpunk UI

Apply the “NeoJackpot” theme to this site. The design should feel like a sleek fusion of Las Vegas slot machine energy and Cyberpunk 2077's futuristic glow — bold, neon, and dopamine-rich without being tacky or cluttered. Maintain a dark-mode core with vivid accent bursts.

Here’s the full visual direction:

🎰 SLOT MACHINE ENERGY
- UI should evoke a sense of reward, momentum, and interactivity.
- Slot-style buttons, pull-to-spin motion, and jackpot language are welcome.

🌌 CYBERPUNK ELEMENTS
- Base background: deep black or #0A0A23 grid with subtle pixel matrix vibe
- Neon accents:  
  - Pink: #FF007F  
  - Cyan: #00FFFF  
  - Gold (sparingly): #FFD700  
- Text color: #E0E0FF for readability
- Font: bold, clean sans-serif — readable in dark mode, strong headings

📐 LAYOUT & POLISH
- Use flexbox/grid for centering and responsive spacing
- Make loadout history cards feel like digital modules — add subtle shadows, hover states, or glowing dividers
- Remove harsh white backgrounds or generic containers — use gradients like `linear-gradient(135deg, #1a1a40, #3d1c4e)` behind sections

🧼 FINISHING TOUCHES
- Smooth animations with easing (`ease-in-out`)
- Add responsive spacing and margin at footer — current one is too tight
- Ensure mobile view doesn’t stack awkwardly

You can improvise within this theme, but always ask: “Does this feel like a dopamine-fueled tactical slot machine inside a cyberpunk world?” If not, tweak it.

Style name: NeoJackpot.
