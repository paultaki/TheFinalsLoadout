# Multi-Spin Sequence Fix Summary

## Date: 2025-08-14
## Engineer: Lead Implementation

## Problem Statement
The slot machine had critical issues with multi-spin sequences:
1. Spin counter jumped directly to final count (e.g., "5 of 5") without showing progression
2. Only one actual spin animation occurred regardless of selected count
3. Winners not landing centered in viewport
4. Blank frames appearing during spins
5. Multiple `slotSpinComplete` events potentially firing

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Counter Updates**: Loop variables not properly captured, updates happening too fast
2. **Animation Chaining**: Intermediate spins not preserving position/DOM state
3. **Winner Position**: Mismatch between item placement (index 40) and animation expectation (index 20)
4. **Content Generation**: Insufficient items generated for quick spins (only 70 vs 200+ needed)
5. **Legacy Code**: Multiple animation engine versions causing confusion

## Implemented Fixes

### A) Spin Counter Fix ✅
- Captured loop variables properly: `const capturedSpin = currentSpin; const capturedTotal = totalSpins;`
- Added 250ms delay after counter update for visual feedback
- Added instrumentation: `[SPIN] start capturedSpin=X of Y, isFirst=?, isFinal=?`

### B) Position Preservation ✅  
- First spin: Build DOM once with `populateScrollContainers(true, false)`
- Intermediate spins: Preserve DOM with `populateScrollContainers(false, true)`
- Use `animateQuickSpin(columns, scrollContents, true)` for position continuity
- Added 300ms pause between spins for visual separation

### C) Final Centering ✅
- Enhanced `ensureFinalWinnerPosition()` with strict ±2px tolerance
- Force snap to -1520px if off-center
- Added assertion logging for QA validation
- Single event dispatch with `[EVENT] slotSpinComplete fired once` logging

### D) Legacy Cleanup ✅
- Deleted legacy `animation-engine.js` (was class AnimationEngine)
- Verified only `animation-engine-v2.js` (class AnimationEngineV2) is loaded in index.html
- Confirmed v2 engine preserves unwrapped position correctly
- All references use AnimationEngineV2 class exclusively

### E) Content Generation ✅
- Increased random spin content from 70 to 220 items (200 + 20 padding)
- Matches winner content generation for consistency
- Added start padding to prevent top gaps
- Ensures full viewport coverage at all velocities

## Key Code Changes

### slot-machine.js
```javascript
// Line 657-670: Fixed counter updates
const capturedSpin = currentSpin;
const capturedTotal = totalSpins;
const isFirstSpin = capturedSpin === 1;
const isFinalSpin = capturedSpin === capturedTotal;

console.log(`[SPIN] start capturedSpin=${capturedSpin} of ${capturedTotal}, isFirst=${isFirstSpin}, isFinal=${isFinalSpin}`);
this.updateSpinCounter(capturedSpin, capturedTotal);
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 250));

// Line 365: Fixed winner position
const winnerPosition = 20; // Changed from 40

// Line 1240-1250: Strict centering enforcement
if (positionDiff > 2) {
    console.warn(`⚠️ ${columnType} position off by ${positionDiff}px, force centering to -1520px`);
    column.itemsContainer.style.transform = `translateY(${targetPosition}px)`;
}

// Line 1190-1200: Increased content generation
const targetItems = 200; // Changed from 50
```

## Validation Metrics

### Acceptance Criteria ✅
1. Counter shows 1→2→3→4→5 with visible pauses
2. Each spin completes before next begins
3. Final position: -1520px ±2px tolerance
4. Single `slotSpinComplete` event per sequence
5. No blank frames during spins
6. Winners highlight only after landing

### Test Matrix
- 3 classes (Light/Medium/Heavy) × 5 spin counts (1-5) = 15 scenarios
- Created `test-multi-spin.html` for automated validation
- Instrumentation logs for debugging (remove for production)

## Performance Impact
- Reduced DOM manipulation (no rebuilds between spins)
- Consistent 220-item generation prevents dynamic allocation
- Position preservation reduces calculation overhead
- Expected smooth 60fps throughout multi-spin sequences

## Files Modified
1. `/v3/slot-machine.js` - Main logic fixes
2. `/v3/animation-engine.js` - DELETED (legacy code removed)
3. `/v3/animation-engine-v2.js` - The only animation engine now
4. `/v3/CLAUDE.md` - Updated winner index documentation
5. `/v3/test-multi-spin.html` - Test suite (new)

## Production Checklist
- [ ] Remove instrumentation logs (`[SPIN]`, `[EVENT]`, `[COUNTER]`)
- [ ] Verify no console errors in 100 spin test
- [ ] Check memory usage stays stable
- [ ] Test on mobile devices
- [ ] Update version number in index.html

## Known Limitations
- Minimum 200ms between spins for counter visibility
- 300ms pause after intermediate spins (by design)
- Strict -1520px centering may cause micro-adjustments

## Future Improvements
- Consider WebGL for smoother high-speed animations
- Implement requestIdleCallback for DOM updates
- Add telemetry for spin timing analysis
