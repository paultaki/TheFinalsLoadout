# The Finals Loadout Generator v3 - Project Status

## Overview
The Finals Loadout Generator v3 is a web-based slot machine that generates random loadouts for The Finals game. It features physics-based animations, multi-spin sequences, and Sentry error monitoring.

## Current Status (2025-08-16)
✅ **PRODUCTION READY** - All critical issues resolved
- Animation system functioning correctly
- Image resolution at 100% success rate
- CSS loading fixed for production domain

## Critical Fixes Applied (2025-08-16)

### 1. Respin Animation Fix
**Problem**: Respin animations weren't triggering - number stayed static after first spin
**Solution**: 
- Added DOM reflow forcing with `offsetHeight` in `automated-flow.js`
- Added 50ms delay to ensure DOM readiness
- Fixed at lines 200-201 in `autoSelectSpins()` and `autoSelectClass()`

### 2. Slot Machine Initialization
**Problem**: Slot machine never appeared after pre-slot animations
**Solution**: 
- Added `AutomatedFlowManager` initialization in `app.js` (lines 352-358)
- Previously the manager class was defined but never instantiated

### 3. Image Resolution System
**Problem**: Blank images appearing due to inconsistent naming and missing assets
**Solution Created**:
- Built centralized `name-to-asset.js` resolver with:
  - Name normalization (handles case, spaces, special chars)
  - Comprehensive aliasing (Stun Gun → Nullifier, etc.)
  - Deprecated item handling (Recon Senses removed from game)
  - 100% resolution rate verified by `verify-assets.mjs`
- Removed duplicate `v3/loadouts.json`, unified to single source
- Updated all loaders to use main `/loadouts.json`

### 4. CSS Transform Conflicts
**Problem**: Items landing at wrong positions (-1480px instead of -1520px)
**Root Cause**: 
- `transform: translateZ(0)` optimization was overriding position transforms
- `scrollSpin` animation interfering with programmatic positioning
**Solution**:
- Separated optimization rules for `.slot-window` and `.slot-items`
- Commented out conflicting `scrollSpin` animation
- Items now correctly land at -1520px (center position)

### 5. Production CSS Loading Issue
**Problem**: Completely broken formatting when accessing from .com domain
**Solution**:
- Changed all relative paths to absolute paths in `index.html`
- CSS: `style.css` → `/v3/style.css`
- JS: `script.js` → `/v3/script.js`
- Images: `../images/` → `/images/`
- Fixed favicon and preload paths

## Recent Fix Attempts (2025-08-14)

### Animation System Fixes
1. **Physics-Based Deceleration**
   - Natural velocity decay to <12px/s without timeouts
   - Target position: -1520px (center row)
   - Device pixel snapping: `Math.round(y * devicePixelRatio) / devicePixelRatio`

2. **Multi-Spin Continuity**
   - DOM preserved between spins (no rebuilding)
   - Continuous unwrappedY tracking
   - Only final spin decelerates to winners
   - Zero pauses between intermediate spins

3. **Winner Highlighting**
   - No pre-highlighting during spins
   - 100ms delay after landing for simultaneous highlight
   - 700ms celebration animation with pulse/glow effect

4. **Viewport Enforcement**
   - Locked at 240px (3 rows × 80px items)
   - Center row (index 1) for winner placement
   - CSS dimensions use `!important` to prevent override

## Architecture

### Core Files
- `animation-engine-v2.js` - Physics-based animation engine with monotonic motion
- `slot-machine.js` - Slot machine logic, DOM management, winner determination
- `automated-flow.js` - Multi-spin orchestration and user flow
- `app.js` - Main application controller and event coordination
- `history-system.js` - Loadout history with localStorage persistence

### CSS Structure
- `style.css` - Base styles
- `polish-styles.css` - Viewport dimensions and animations
- `bonus-styles.css` - Bonus system visuals
- `selection-styles.css` - Selection UI

- Added 50ms delay for DOM update visibility
- Counter now properly increments: 1 → 2 → 3

### Animation Duration Fix  
- Reduced timeout from 30s to 5s maximum
- Implemented aggressive velocity decay (0.92 at 100px, 0.85 at 50px)
- Relaxed completion criteria: distance ≤ 2px OR velocity ≤ 5px/s

### Landing Position Fix
- Simplified target calculation for exact -1520px landing
- Fixed wrapped position calculation error (was landing at -1480px)
- Direct calculation without complex modulo math

## History UI Refinement (2025-08-16 Session 2)

### Visual Enhancements Applied
**Problem**: History cards needed visual refinement with modular icon-based design
**Constraint**: Preserve 100% of existing responsive architecture and mobile optimizations
**Solution Implemented**:

#### New Files Created:
- **history-styles-refined.css** - Enhanced visual styles with bordered equipment cards
- **history-system-enhanced.js** - Icon support and improved card rendering  
- **test-history-ui.html** - Responsive testing interface (320px → 1440px)
- **verify-history-ui.js** - Comprehensive verification suite
- **HISTORY_UI_IMPLEMENTATION.md** - Complete implementation documentation

#### Visual Changes:
- Individual bordered equipment cards with semi-transparent backgrounds
- Purple gradient borders (1-2px) using CSS mask technique
- Icon support (40px) with lazy loading and fallback styling
- Hover effects with subtle elevation (translateY(-2px))
- Dark/transparent backgrounds with high contrast text
- CSS custom properties for theming control

#### Preserved Architecture:
- Original DOM structure completely unchanged
- All existing classes retained (new ones added)
- Mobile breakpoints intact (768px, 480px)  
- Touch targets maintained at 44px+ on mobile
- Container width and responsive behavior preserved
- JavaScript event bindings untouched

### Testing & Verification
```bash
# Local testing
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Navigate to: http://localhost:8000/v3/test-history-ui.html

# Run verification suite in browser console:
new HistoryUIVerification().runAll()
```

### Icon Mapping
Complete equipment icon mapping added for:
- All weapons (Light, Medium, Heavy)
- All specializations  
- All gadgets
- Images load from `/images/` directory with `.webp` format
- Graceful fallback to colored circles when icons missing

### Rollback Instructions
If needed, remove these two lines from index.html:
- Line 95: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="/v3/history-styles-refined.css?v=20250816" />`
- Line 482: `<script src="/v3/history-system-enhanced.js?v=20250816" defer></script>`

## Recent Updates (2025-08-18)

### Filter System Temporarily Hidden
**Status**: Complete implementation ready but hidden for launch
**Location**: Filter button hidden via CSS in `style.css` lines 238-241
**Implementation**: 
- Full filter system architecture preserved in `filter-system.js`
- Filter panel UI complete in `index.html` (lines 132-137 for button, filter panel below)
- All event handlers and localStorage persistence functional
- CSS styles ready in `style.css` (filter panel section)

**To Re-enable Filters**:
1. Remove or comment out lines 238-241 in `style.css`:
   ```css
   /* Temporarily hide filter button - remove this when ready to launch filters */
   #filter-toggle {
     display: none !important;
   }
   ```
2. Filter system will immediately be functional with:
   - Weapon/gadget/specialization toggles
   - Per-class filtering
   - Preference persistence in localStorage
   - Smooth slide-in animation from right

### Recon Senses Removal
**Removed from game**: The specialization "Recon Senses" no longer exists in The Finals
**Files Updated**:
- `loadout-loader.js` line 72 - Removed from image mapping
- `app.js` line 93 - Removed from Medium specializations array  
- `slot-machine.js` line 93 - Removed from Medium specializations array
- No image file existed (was using placeholder)

### Spin Again Button Fix
**Problem**: "resetAnimation is not a function" error when clicking Spin Again
**Root Cause**: `SimpleSpinAnimation` class was missing the `resetAnimation()` method
**Solution**: Added `resetAnimation()` method to `simple-spin-animation.js` (lines 292-302)
- Method stops any running animations
- Resets isSpinning flag  
- Clears all transforms back to translateY(0)

## Last Updated
2025-08-18 - Filter system hidden for launch (easily re-enabled), Recon Senses removed, Spin Again button fixed.
