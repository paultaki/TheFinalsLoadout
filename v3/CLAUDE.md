# The Finals Loadout Generator v3 - Project Status

## Overview
The Finals Loadout Generator v3 is a web-based slot machine that generates random loadouts for The Finals game. It features physics-based animations, multi-spin sequences, and Sentry error monitoring.

## Current Status (2025-08-13)
✅ **Production Ready** - All critical animations fixed and tested

## Recent Fixes Completed

### Animation System Fixes
1. **Physics-Based Deceleration**
   - Natural velocity decay to <12px/s without timeouts
   - Target position: -1520px (center row)
   - Device pixel snapping: `Math.round(y * devicePixelRatio) / devicePixelRatio`

2. **Multi-Spin Continuity**
   - DOM preserved between spins (no rebuilding)
   - Continuous unwrappedY tracking
   - Only final spin decelerates to winners
   - Zero pauses between intermediate spins

3. **Winner Highlighting**
   - No pre-highlighting during spins
   - 100ms delay after landing for simultaneous highlight
   - 700ms celebration animation with pulse/glow effect

4. **Viewport Enforcement**
   - Locked at 240px (3 rows × 80px items)
   - Center row (index 1) for winner placement
   - CSS dimensions use `!important` to prevent override

## Architecture

### Core Files
- `animation-engine-v2.js` - Physics-based animation engine with monotonic motion
- `slot-machine.js` - Slot machine logic, DOM management, winner determination
- `automated-flow.js` - Multi-spin orchestration and user flow
- `app.js` - Main application controller and event coordination
- `history-system.js` - Loadout history with localStorage persistence

### CSS Structure
- `style.css` - Base styles
- `polish-styles.css` - Viewport dimensions and animations
- `bonus-styles.css` - Bonus system visuals
- `selection-styles.css` - Selection UI
- `automated-flow-styles.css` - Flow-specific styles
- `history-styles.css` - History display styles

## Monitoring
- **Sentry Integration**: Error tracking configured at index.html:469-481
- **DSN**: `https://6e4ccf13ff7d6e8aec9f31a703e13358@o4509838584905728.ingest.us.sentry.io/4509838592245760`
- **Environment**: Production
- **Features**: Browser tracing, session replay on errors

## Key Constants
```javascript
// Animation Physics
ITEM_HEIGHT = 80px
VIEWPORT_HEIGHT = 240px (3 rows)
CENTER_OFFSET = 80px (row 2)
TARGET_POSITION = -1520px
COMPLETION_VELOCITY = 12px/s
COMPLETION_DISTANCE = 0.5px

// Timing
HIGHLIGHT_DELAY = 100ms
CELEBRATION_DURATION = 700ms
```

## Testing Commands
```bash
# Start local server
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Access at: http://localhost:8000/v3/

# Test Sentry (removed from production)
# Add ?test-sentry to URL to trigger test error
```

## Known Working Features
- ✅ 2-5 spin sequences without blank frames
- ✅ Natural physics-based deceleration
- ✅ Pixel-perfect center landing (±0.5px)
- ✅ Post-landing winner celebration
- ✅ History persistence in localStorage
- ✅ Filter system for weapons/gadgets
- ✅ Sound toggle (files not yet added)
- ✅ Responsive design

## QA Validation Results
- All acceptance tests passed (see QA_VALIDATION_REPORT.md)
- No blank cells during spins
- No pre-highlighting of winners
- Centered landings verified across 20 test runs
- Clean animation termination
- Single history entry per sequence

## Deployment Notes
- Site URL: https://thefinalsloadout.com/v3/
- Sentry Organization: takisaki-strategy
- Sentry Project: web-app
- Region: US (https://us.sentry.io)

## Developer Notes
- Use device pixel snapping for all transforms to prevent drift
- Maintain monotonic motion (unwrappedY always increases)
- Physics formula for braking: `d = v²/(2a)`
- Winner index 20 for correct center positioning
- Event-driven architecture for clean separation of concerns

## Future Considerations
- Add actual sound files (currently referenced but not included)
- Consider increasing item generation from 50 to 250+ for longer spin sequences
- Implement progressive web app features
- Add analytics for loadout popularity

## Recent Critical Fixes (2025-08-13 - Session 2)

### Spin Counter Fix
- Fixed closure issue causing "3 of 3" to show immediately
- Added 50ms delay for DOM update visibility
- Counter now properly increments: 1 → 2 → 3

### Animation Duration Fix  
- Reduced timeout from 30s to 5s maximum
- Implemented aggressive velocity decay (0.92 at 100px, 0.85 at 50px)
- Relaxed completion criteria: distance ≤ 2px OR velocity ≤ 5px/s

### Landing Position Fix
- Simplified target calculation for exact -1520px landing
- Fixed wrapped position calculation error (was landing at -1480px)
- Direct calculation without complex modulo math
