Ok on the finalsloadout.com for the random loadout generator I have a filter system in place that allows users to exclude certain classes, weapons, specilizations or gadgets from appearing in the random loadout. on my new site at /thefinalsloadout/v3 that I'm testing and almost ready to move into production to replace my current site, I don' thave a working filter system but i need ot impliment one. I don't want claude code to mess with any other architecture on the site, the formatting of everythign works really well on desktop and mobile so I want to ensure that stays the same. the filter system needs to be an overlay. There is a button for it in the top right of the screen but theres no content. so we need to wire it all up so it lists all the items, and 2 of the 3 animations need to be aware of what was selected. The random class selector and the slot machine need to adhere to it.
